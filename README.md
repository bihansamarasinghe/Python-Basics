## Overview

Python is a high-level, versatile programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Python scripts are sequences of instructions written in the Python language and executed in a Python environment.

This README provides a basic understanding of Python scripting, covering key aspects such as script structure, syntax, variables, data types, control flow, functions, modules, file input/output, and how to run a Python script.

## Script Structure

A simple Python script structure includes:

```python
# Your script code here

print("Hello, World!")
```

## Comments

Comments in Python start with `#` and are used to annotate the script with human-readable information. Comments are ignored during script execution.

## Variables

Variables in Python are assigned using the syntax `variable_name = value`. Example:

```python
greeting = "Hello, World!"
print(greeting)
```

## Data Types

Python supports various data types, including integers, floats, strings, booleans, lists, tuples, dictionaries, and more. Example:

```python
number = 42
pi = 3.14
message = "Hello, World!"
is_python_fun = True
```

## Control Flow

### Conditional Statements

- **if-elif-else statement:**
  ```python
  if condition:
      # code if condition is true
  elif another_condition:
      # code if another_condition is true
  else:
      # code if all conditions are false
  ```

### Loops

- **For loop:**
  ```python
  for i in range(5):
      # code to repeat
  ```

- **While loop:**
  ```python
  while condition:
      # code to repeat
  ```

## Functions

Functions in Python are defined and called using the following syntax:

```python
def function_name(parameters):
    # function body
    return result

# Call the function
result = function_name(arguments)
```

## Modules

Python modules allow you to organize code into separate files. You can import modules using the `import` statement.

## File Input/Output

Python supports reading from and writing to files using the `open()` function and file objects.

## Running a Python Script

1. Run the script using the Python interpreter:
   ```bash
   python script_name.py
   ```

2. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x script_name.py
   ```

   Run the script directly:
   ```bash
   ./script_name.py
   ```
